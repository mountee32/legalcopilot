# Workflow Specs

US workflow specs will live in this folder.

Current status:

- Legacy UK workflow assets were moved to `docs/archive/uk/workflows/`.
- New workflow artifacts should follow US jurisdiction-aware modeling and align with `backlog/waiting/way-forward.md`.

Authoring guidelines:

- Model compliance and irreversible gates, not legal strategy.
- Separate federal baseline rules from state overlays.
- Keep workflow templates minimal and auditable.
