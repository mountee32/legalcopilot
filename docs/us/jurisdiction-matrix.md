## Rule Layering Model

1. Federal baseline rules
2. State overlays
3. Firm-specific overlays

## State Overlay Requirements (per state)

- Deadline and limitation calculations
- Filing and service process constraints
- Trust accounting and billing policy flags
- Required evidence/approval gates by workflow stage
- Localized terminology templates

## Change Control

- All rule pack changes must be versioned and effective-dated
- Rule changes require ADR reference and regression eval run
