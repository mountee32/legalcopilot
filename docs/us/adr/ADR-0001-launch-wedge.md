Accepted

## Decision

Launch with Workers' Compensation and Personal Injury as first US practice packs.

## Rationale

- High document and workflow volume
- Strong fit for extraction + reconciliation + deadline/action automation
- Faster measurable ROI in pilot cohorts

## Consequences

- Initial roadmap prioritizes these two packs for eval quality and UX fit
- Other practice areas remain planned but gated by launch quality outcomes
