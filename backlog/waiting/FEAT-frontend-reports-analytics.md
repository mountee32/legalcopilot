# FEAT: Frontend — Reports & Analytics (MVP)

## Goal

Provide initial reporting pages that are accurate and drillable.

## Scope

- Basic breakdowns by practice area / fee earner / status
- Export (CSV) if supported

## Dependencies

- Backlog: `backlog/waiting/TASK-api-reporting-analytics.md` (new aggregate endpoints)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Metrics are sourced from a single, documented API contract
- Users can click through from summary to underlying records
