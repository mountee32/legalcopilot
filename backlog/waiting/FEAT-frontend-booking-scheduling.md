# FEAT: Frontend — Booking & Scheduling

## Goal

Enable prospects/clients to book appointments and feed outcomes into matters/leads.

## Scope

- Admin UI for appointment types, availability windows, buffers
- Public booking page/widget (minimal)
- Client portal booking entry point (follow-ups)

## Dependencies

- Backlog: `backlog/waiting/TASK-api-booking-scheduling.md` (booking endpoints + availability rules + calendar integration)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Bookings create calendar events and link to lead/matter appropriately
- Confirmation and reminder messaging is configured (or explicitly out of scope)

## References

- `docs/ideas.md` (Epic 18)
