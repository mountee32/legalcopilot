# FEAT: Frontend — Online Payments & Collections

## Goal

Make it easy for clients to pay and for the firm to track collections.

## Scope

- Invoice “Pay now” surfaces (portal + staff)
- Payments list/detail and basic reconciliation visibility
- Collections queue (overdue invoices + suggested actions) if supported

## Dependencies

- API: payments endpoints and invoice endpoints
- Backlog: `backlog/waiting/TASK-api-payments-collections.md` (payment link creation, DD mandates, dunning schedules)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Payment status is visible and ties back to invoices
- Client payment flow is safe and clearly branded

- `docs/ideas.md` (Epic 16)
